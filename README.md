# Lightyear Software Company

Lightyear is a fictional enterprise software company. In this project, a website has been developed for this software company. Before it was developed, the websites of many different software companies were examined and the necessary sections were determined. If we think of the whole project as a system, this system has 2 ends: the main panel that users see, and the admin panel that admins have access to. Users can access and interact with the About, Team, Services, Carrier, Blog, and Contact pages on the main panel. In the Admin Panel, the pages in the Main Panel are controlled and edited. Through these controls, direct communication with the database is established.

## Technologies

This website was created by using Model-View-Controller, a.k.a MVC, architectural pattern. The backend of the project was developed using the ASP.NET framework. Entity Framework, an ORM tool, was used on the database side, and properties (DbContext and Classes) were created with the Code First method. MSSQL was used as database management system. Technologies and libraries such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and JQuery were used on the frontend of the project.
